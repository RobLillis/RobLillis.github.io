<h1> Skiing and Snowboarding Resorts! </h1>

<p> Love the snow? Well Maine's the right chose if you do. We have a few places fairly cheap compared to others around the country to hit the slopes. </p>

<p> If you do decide to come visit Maine for Skiing and Snowboarding I'd highly suggest visiting Big Rock and Sugar loaf. Only problem is Big Rock is North and Sugar Loaf is South. So if your from Northern States I'd visit Big Rock, and if your anywhere South Sugar Loaf would be my recommendation. </p>

<P> If you would like to check out the different locations the link is below.</P>

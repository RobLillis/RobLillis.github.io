        <h2> What Makes Maine Different? </h2>
       </u>
       </p>
         <p> Have you ever visited Maine? Well if you haven't this will be a valuable source for you to figure out if Maine is the right place for you. People value and respect the way "Northerner's" live in Maine. Many places have been polluted and over taken from people and buildings. Maine's truly the last of it's kind. Wouldn't you like to experience what it's like to live in the woods, and not in the city? Experience what it's like to be connected to nature, and rely on yourself. Maine's one of the best places to build responsible and good work ethic in individuals.  </p>

<p> The great outdoor's of Maine. Camping is a love hate kind of thing if you've ever experienced it. The best parts of camping are; cooking up some food, spending time with friends or family, hearing and seeing nature, looking at the sky during the night, survival instincts pop in, and the list goes on. Personal experience I'd choose to camp near a mountain so then you can wake up early and watch the sunrise while putting in a good work out. Come to man to escape "City Reality".  </p>

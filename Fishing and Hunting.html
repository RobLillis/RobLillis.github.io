<h1> Fishing and Hunting in Maine! </h1>
    <p>Ever tried fishing or hunting? Well Maine's filled with many activities, but these two are essential survival for life in the woods alone.</p>
<p>What do you typically do on the weekends or week days in the morning? Well in Maine it's a great hobby/habit many of us have is to wake up fresh and early. Then start the day off with catching dinner for the night. It's a great feeling and can save some money.</p>

<p> Hunting's going to be a little difficult because you'll need a hunting license, but it's not really the licence that's the problem. It's usually having land to hunt on. Some owners allow locals and other enthusiast hunters on their lands just as long as you respect, and don't ruin the property and the animal population.   </p>

    <p> Hunting's a great hobby many Mainer's participate in. I only ask as a Mainer that you eat what you kill. </p>
